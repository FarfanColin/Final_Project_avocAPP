## Project Context
> I would like more people were aware about on how many meat-free and free-cruelty products are available 
to buy, the main goal I have in mind is to create a web site where people could go there and check the list 
of products. I completely understand that this project takes more than two months to get it done, so I would 
like to develop the fundamentals and start building this final project. 

## Areas to cover
> This project will use many technologies, reason why it is important to know the basic functionality of each tool applied.
* Node js, being that it’s fast and it’s possible to use JS to build the client side as the server side.
* Express js, as it is necessary to use a framework.
* React, to structure our view by the different components.
* JavaScript, being that most of the code will be written in this language
* MongoDB, as our database, so it will be possible to store the information by documents and collections
* Mongoose as Object Data Modelling (ODM) altogether with MongoDB Compass, to present our data, since the 
project will use different collections
* Bootstrap, to build the front-end framework.
* Visual Studio Code, as we need to have a code editor.
* Git BASH, to interact with the GitHub account, besides of the VSC terminal. This is not a must be, but 
I like it because it is fast and simple.

## Example usage
> As an example, in the web page we have a project with the name "Bug Tracker", this plan allows us
to solve a problem we are facing, so every time that the user is having issues of any matter, just
post a new issue on the web page and later on the admin itself or an user will give support on the 
comments section and once the problem is solved or it doesnt have anything else to add, it will be
closed by the admin.

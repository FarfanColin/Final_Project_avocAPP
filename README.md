## Project Context
> <p align="justify"> I would like more people were aware about on how many meat-free and free-cruelty products are available to buy, the main goal I have in mind is to create a web site where people could go there and check the list of products. I completely understand that this project takes more than two months to get it done, so I would like to develop the fundamentals. </p>

## Areas to cover
> This project will use many technologies, reason why it is important to know the basic functionality of each tool applied.
* Node js, being that it’s fast and it’s possible to use JS to build the client side as the server side.
* Express js, as it is necessary to use a framework.
* React, to structure our view by the different components.
* JavaScript, being that most of the code will be written in this language
* MongoDB, as our database, so it will be possible to store the information by documents and collections
* Mongoose as Object Data Modelling (ODM) altogether with MongoDB Compass, to present our data, since the project will use different collections
* Bootstrap, to build the front-end framework.
* Visual Studio Code, as we need to have a code editor.
* Git BASH, to interact with the GitHub account, besides of the VSC terminal. This is not a must be, but I like it because it is fast and simple.

## Functional Requirements
> Every functionality implicates an interaction between the web application and the user:
* The user will visit the web application and will navigate throughout the side.
* Once the user is interested on one item, it will be necessary to register
* Being that the user is already registered, the next time to visit the site, it will be just necessary to log in, so all the orders made will be registered on its account.
* The user will have the opportunity to add as much items as it desires, and those products will go to their cart.
* Once the user is done with the shopping, it will be possible to procced to the checkout, where it has to be mandatory to confirm their personal data, so an invoice will be originated from the site.
* There is a special section named “Contact Us”, where the user can send a message concerning to the products announced on the web application.
* The last but not least, the “About Us” section where the customer will find a brief description about avocAPP and how the company is committed with the world.

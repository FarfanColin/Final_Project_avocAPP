## Functionality
> Basically my project is based on a front-end web page, where it is possible to find the solution
to the different bugs we have to deal with by getting the advice from users or even de admin.
At the home page, we could see a simple welcome message, following by the developer's name and the
link to the repository in GitHub, in case it is necessary to check the code. At the top of the home
page we find four options (comments, issues, projects, users) the ones that allow us to navigate
through the whole page.
Going over the comments page, this option give us the possibility to see the current discussion
on every bug, the solutions given, tips to do troubleshooting, etc.
Then, over the issues page we have the choice to see all troubles have been emerged, so it is
possible to have a look at them instead of duplicate the issues to avoid confussion between the users.
The next stage is based on the projects page, it is possible to add as many projects as we want to,
so if there is any issue according to the posts made, it will be easier to solve a trouble.
The final page is the users one, as the name specifies every person who is interacting with the
web page will be listed on this side, dont matter the usertype.

## Set it up
> First step, provide valid data to connect to our MongoDB, it means our credentials from MongoDB Atlas,
once this is done, our database mentioned in our JavaScript will be ready to push and pull data.
Second step is running our code, to perform this step, it will be neccessary to do it by "npm start",
once this step is done, we just need to wait to get the "Server connected succesfully" message to 
open the browser with the port indicated and we are ready to go.

## Technologies used
* MongoDB Atlas
* Robo 3T
* JavaScript
* EJS
* CSS
* Visual Studio Code
* React Native

## Example usage
> As an example, in the web page we have a project with the name "Bug Tracker", this plan allows us
to solve a problem we are facing, so every time that the user is having issues of any matter, just
post a new issue on the web page and later on the admin itself or an user will give support on the 
comments section and once the problem is solved or it doesnt have anything else to add, it will be
closed by the admin.
